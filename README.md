<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ronny Desfriana Saputra</h1>

I'm a passionate web3 educator, content creator, and community manager dedicated to spreading blockchain literacy and empowering decentralized technologies.

As a lifelong learner, I'm constantly exploring new developments in the web3 space. I enjoy creating educational resources, leading hands-on workshops, and bringing complex crypto concepts to life for others.

Community is at the heart of web3, and I love fostering engaged communities by moderating discussions, facilitating events, and nurturing an inclusive environment.

Outside of web3 you can find me playing chess or classical guitar, photography, and spending time in nature.
